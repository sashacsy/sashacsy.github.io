### Integrating CollectionBuilder and Oral History (as) Data to build a virtual exhibit
<br><br>

I was grateful to have the opportunity last summer to create <a href="https://ubc-library-rbsc.github.io/gillis-2021/"><i>I Know We'll Meet Again: Correspondence and the forced dispersal of Japanese Canadians</i></a>, a virtual exhibit featuring letters from the Joan Gillis fonds at UBC Library's Rare Books & Special Collections. My co-curator, Mya Ballin, and I chose to integrate two tools developed by the Centre for Digital Inquiry and Learning at the University of Idaho<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>: CollectionBuilder<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> and Oral History (as) Data<sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>.
